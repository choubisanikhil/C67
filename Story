  The Tortoise And The Bird

  A Tortoise was restitng under a tree on which a Bird had built its nest. The Tortoise spoke to the Bird mockingly, "What 
  a shabby home you have! it is made of broken twicks, it has no roof, and looks crude. What's worse is that you had to
  build it yourself. I think my house, which is my shell, is better than your pathetic nest".

  "Yes, it is made of broken sticks, looks shabby and is open to elements of nature. It is crude but I built it,
  and I like it."

  "I guess its just like any other nest, but not better than mine", said the Tortoise. "You must be jeoluse of my shell,
  though".

  "On the contary", the bird replied. "My home has space for my family and friends, your shell cannot acomaodate anyone
  other then you. Maybe you have a better house but I have a better home", said the bird happliy.

  Moral: Better a crowded hut than alonely mansion.
