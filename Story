  The Tortoise And The Bird

  A Tortoise was restitng under a tree on which a Bird had built its nest. The Tortoise spoke to the Bird mockingly, "What 
  a shabby home you have! it is made of broken twicks, it has no roof, and looks crude. What's worse is that you had to
  build it yourself. I think my house, which is my shell, is better than your pathetic nest".
